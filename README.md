# Yara Fe Tuguinay - Portfolio Task

## Live Site Link 
(https://yara-fe.github.io/shecodesportfolio/))

## Content
This is a personal portfolio website which consists of two webpages: 

1. **Home page** displays my personal logo and slogan and a section for my current and future projects.
2. **About page** displays my biography, profile picture and a little snippet of personal facts.

Both pages consists of a the same header and footer format. 

The **header** consists of my logo which links to the Home page, a navigation bar and a Say Hello! button.

The **footer** consists of a contact message, my social links, a contact form, footer navigation bar and a copyright information.

## Technical
This project has been version controlled with Git. I have consistently committed my changes to Git, along with comments during each commit. 
My website has also been deployed on GitHub pages.

Througout developing the site, I have aimed to implement responsive design principles by designing with mobile first approach and using the media query to apply desktop-mode fomatting.
On mobile view, the navigation bar will change to a hamburger icon to accomodate for the smaller screen size. The footer will also display vertically.
I have also tried to use semantic HTML as much as possible to ensure that my code is structured and easily readable by others.

## Bonus
To challenge myself, I have added the following functionalities in my website:

1. **Hover styles:** 
- Buttons will change colours when hovered over by the user. 
- Navigation item will change colour and be underlined if hovered over.
- Portfolio image will display info and tools used when hovered over.

2. **Javascript:**
- I used Javascript to be able to display the mobile navigation bar when the hamburger icon is clicked.
